# 3-Point-Shot
This project was for a school assignment. This code is a Python animation of a basketball flying through the air and scoring a basket. The ball follows a parabolic trajectory. The human shooter jumps straight up, releasing the ball as he starts to jump, and the falls back to the ground under the influence of gravity. THe person and the ball are subjected to the same strength of gravity, but have different initial upward speeds, so that the ball rises higher than the person.
